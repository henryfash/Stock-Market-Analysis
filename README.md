# Stock Market Analysis
Stock Market Analysis means analyzing the current and historical trends in the stock market to make future buying and selling decisions.
#### I analyzed the stock price of Amazon using Python.  
  1. I used the yfinance API of Yahoo Finance for collecting the stock price data
  2. I used a candlestick chart to analyze price movement of the stock price.
  3. Showed the close price using a bar plot.
  4. I used rangeslider to analyze the stock market between two specific points by interactively selecting the time period.
  5. Added buttons for selecting the time period (1 Month(1m), 3 Months(3m), 6 Months(6m) and 1 year(1y)) for stock market analysis.
